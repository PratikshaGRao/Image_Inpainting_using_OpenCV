# Image_Inpainting_using_OpenCV

Image In-painting is a process of restorative conservation of images, where damaged, deteriorating, or missing parts of an artwork are reconstructed, ultimately with the goal of presenting the artwork as it was originally created.

It involves application of sophisticated algorithms to replace lost or corrupted parts of the image data using mainly pixel prediction.
